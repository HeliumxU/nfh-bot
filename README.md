# nfh-bot
Simple Discord Bot, - remote management planned.

Planned - <Image to text using IronOCR, Ban & Kicking options, Namechanger>

Not working on - <Logging, Easier Management, WinApp Layout>

Simple Discord Bot I'm making in my spare time and any downtime I have at work. Currently it's just me,
a 17y/o total noob at coding who works on it, and I'd love recommendations and features to add, and maybe a bit of help adding them.

And for a last time; plastering this sign, because it's important.
